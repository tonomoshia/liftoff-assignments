# Project Outline
### Overview

**MilkMatch** is a peer-to-peer milk sharing service matching mothers in need of milk for their babies with mothers who have an oversupply of breastmilk. 
Currently there is a [group on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/hm4hb/) that has a global network of chapters of mothers sharing milk with each other. The problem is that the offers and requests are not searchable and a mother would have to scroll through many many requests and offers before finding one that meets their needs. 
One member of our group, Elizabeth Reiher, used the [Florida group](https://www.facebook.com/hm4hbflorida/) to donate milk and experience this and felt that it was a barrier to matching people. With our service, the mothers will able to filter for what they are looking for (dairy-free, medication-free, etc) and by location.
### Features
